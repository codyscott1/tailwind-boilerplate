# Tailwind boilerplate

Based on the half helix [Shopify Starter Theme](https://www.figma.com/file/GY13fltZXHlOZTwOJ9sIb4/Shopify-Starter-Theme-%5B2021%5D?node-id=3646%3A39750). Copy `tailwind.config.js` as a starting point.

The config is still a work in progress and needs updates to fully match the starter theme. With tailwind-config-viewer I'm unsure if there is a way to display other default styles like the creation of buttons or form elements from a `buttons.css` or similar file.

## Preview

`yarn; yarn start`

## Build

`yarn; yarn build`

This will update the docs directory with a static version of the current preview. Github pages is serving that docs directory so pushing to main will update the build.
